## 🌎 Abstract 🌎
The last five decades have witnessed a remarkable era of global transformation, marked by profound shifts in climate patterns, population dynamics, and energy consumption trends. These changes, driven by a confluence of natural processes, human activities, and socio-economic factors, have reshaped our planet’s landscape and profoundly impacted ecosystems, societies, and economies worldwide. Against the backdrop of escalating concerns over climate change, resource depletion, and demographic transitions, understanding the intricate interplay between these interconnected phenomena has emerged as a paramount imperative for sustainable development and collective well-being. In this ambitious endeavor, we embark on a comprehensive exploration of the multifaceted relationships between climate change, population migrations, and energy utilization across nations and regions worldwide. By harnessing extensive datasets spanning diverse temporal and spatial scales, we seek to unravel the underlying dynamics driving these phenomena, identify emerging trends, and illuminate pathways towards fostering resilience, equity, and environmental stewardship in an increasingly interconnected world.

## 📊 Dataset 📊
The datasets underpinning this project constitute a rich and diverse corpus of information, meticulously curated to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex interdependencies shaping our global trajectory. Here, we present a detailed overview of each dataset, elucidating their sources, scope, temporal coverage, geographic extent, key variables, granularity, and data quality assurance measures:

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Audience 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
The visualization tool is designed for everyone, but especially we aim to empower policymakers, researchers, and the general public with the knowledge needed to drive positive change and foster a more sustainable future.

## 🚀 Project structure & Installation 🚀

Our project is structured as follows:

```       
├───data            (Datasets)
├───map             (Coordinates regarding countries)
├───Reports         (Milestone reports)
└───(---Website files below---)
    ├───index.html      (HTML code for main webpage)
    ├───script.js       (Our .js code)
    └───style.css       (Static CSS code for the website)
```

To run our project locally, you need to do:

- Clone the repo
- Move into the folder
- Start a local server (e.g. using ```python3 -m http.server 8080```), the website is generally available at ```http://127.0.0.1:8080```
